# Risk Modeling-for-Loan-Approval

I developed a machine learning model to predict the credit risk of loan default based on applicant data, utilizing LightGBM and scikit-learn. Here’s a summary of my approach:

Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared a loan application dataset, managing both categorical and numerical variables.
Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical features and standardized numerical data to optimize model performance.
Model Training: Built a LightGBM Classifier within a scikit-learn pipeline for efficient preprocessing and training.
Results: Achieved 88% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning, enhancing precision and recall for reliable predictions.
This project highlights the potential of machine learning in financial decision-making and credit risk assessment. I’m eager to explore further improvements and practical applications!
